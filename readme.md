## Lepton  
Lepton is an LWJGL-based java library for optimization, GPU parallel computing, 3d rendering, and other features you would expect in a low-level game engine, like a physics engine (based on [JBullet](http://jbullet.advel.cz)), audio rendering, 3d animation, a wavefront-format (.obj) geometry loader, and much more.
  
A javadoc for Lepton has been provided in /doc/index.html, and is hosted on github pages [here](https://ranchordo.github.io/lepton/).  
  
The license for LWJGL has been included as /LWJGL-LICENSE.txt. No source code from LWJGL has been included. LWJGL-LICENSE is not the license for this project in its entirety. For that, see /LICENSE.  
  
The LWJGL components required for Lepton are:  
1. LWJGL core  
2. LWJGL-OpenGL  
3. LWJGL-GLFW  
4. LWJGL-OpenAL  
5. LWJGL-STB  
  
These LWJGL components are packaged along with the jarfile found in releases and in /dist.
