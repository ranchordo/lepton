## Lepton utils  
This directory contains random utilities for Lepton.  
  
anim-export.py: This is a script for Blender that allows you to export keyframed animation data from blender to a .ani file that Lepton can use. To use it, please select one animated object (make sure it has a rotation mode of Quaterion), and run the script, replacing \[FILENAME\] with the location to export the .ani file.
